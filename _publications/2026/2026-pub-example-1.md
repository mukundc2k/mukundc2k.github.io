abstract: >-
  the choice of using English nouns/verbs in do-verb constructions in Hindi sentences instead of Hindi ones is governed by a bunch of shared constraints between native speakers. some verbs are extremely easy to mix in, others are disagreed upon. given that LLMs are publicised as capable models of data rich languages, English and Hindi, and Hinglish should be fairly represented. however we find that native speaker variation is not reflected in LLM perplexities of various sizes and training language mixes, thus making them not ready to use for modeling human linguistic intuition as well. we use this to start talking about the area and also as a first contribution to model more linguistic variation studies on.
