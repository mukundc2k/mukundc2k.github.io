  pseudowords are weird, they sound real, but mean nothing, and don’t translate across languages. we explore how to automatically generate and evaluate pseudowords in a language-agnostic way, to help universal clinical and psycholinguistic use. we build a reusable pipeline (publicly released) which only uses a basic LSTM and an IPA dictionary of the language, generate Hindi and English pseudowords, and stitch together a cognitive science based, reproducible framework for human evaluation. this leads to Soodkosh, the first mostly automatically generated Hindi pseudoword dataset with a lightweight experiment design to collect psycholinguistic features from native judgements. finally, we show their utility: (1) pseudowords help measure perceived password strength vs. memorability, and (2) we test if swapping them in helps LMs classify aphasia, but find that pseudowords can’t be directly replaced, even if they’re subtly used.
