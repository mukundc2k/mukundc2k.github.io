  for models that are large and are supposed to be good at language, they are kind of bad at human linguistics. we see that LO puzzles which are basic reasoning puzzles based on linguistic phenomena in extremely low resourced languages, but are exhaustive and completely solvable for highschoolers by design, are a challenge for LLMs. this is because they are bad at pattern matching, reasoning, etc. but more concretely we find that linguistic factors like morpholigcal complexity, closeness to English, and amount of evidence to understand how a linguistic feature (as per WALS) works, are highly correlated to poor performance.
