abstract: >-
  We introduce Llama-3-AnonFlavor-Chat, or Anon for short, a new state-of-the-art AnonLang-centric instruction tuned open generative large language model (LLM). Anon is adapted from the LLaMA-3-8B model via continuous pretraining with expansion of transformer blocks, following LLaMA Pro approach. This model employs the decoder-only architecture and has been trained on a mixture of AnonLang and English texts. With 10 billion parameters, Nanda demonstrates improved knowledge and reasoning capabilities in AnonLang, suprassing existing open AnonLang and multilingual models of comparable size by a substantial margin; it also achieves highly competitive performance in English. We release Anon as an open-sourced instruction-tuned model and provide a detailed overview of its training, tuning, safety alignment, and evaluation processes. We believe that this release will foster further research in AnonLang LLMs and support diverse practical applications across various domains.
