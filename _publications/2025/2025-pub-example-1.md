  real-time Hindi sentence comprehension isn’t just about retrieving the right chunks from memory, it’s also about how those chunks distort in our memory while sitting there. we test the representation distortion hypothesis, which says memory doesn’t store sentence parts faithfully; stuff like number features or noun roles can get deleted or swapped to make ungrammatical sentences, grammatical. we design experiments with agreement mismatches and case-marker swaps, and find that deletion errors, especially of number features, are common, and that noun-case distortions make semantically weird sentences feel more okay. studying this in Hindi (which is linguistically different than English in representing case, number, etc.) helps generalise findings and bring out nuances in the field.
