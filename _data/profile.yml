short_bio: >-
  Hello! This is a landing page to know most things linguistics about me. I love linguistics, comics, design and more. Starting out with Linguistics Olympiad in high school, then through a masters in Computational Linguistics and a bunch of super different internships & work experiences, I am now joining a Ph.D. in Natural Language Processing!
  I like to research around problems that need tailor-made & text patterns/analysis driven solutions in domains like low resourced languages, bias-against demographics etc. in the age of trendy NLP.
  Finally as much as I would dabble in anything linguistic, I also like the more human-related aspects of the field, thus bringing in cognitive sciences like psychology, behavioral experiments in methodology etc.

  Hit me up on my twitter, linkedin, or e-mail if you feel interested in anything around these domains or even if you want some quick recommendations on graphic novels to read over a coffee :)
