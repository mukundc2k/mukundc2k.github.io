  welcome to the corner of the internet that is a window to me. before my current PhD i worked as a data scientist and completed my MSc. in Computational Linguistics (10 CGPA) at IIIT Hyderabad, with a thesis at the intersection of cognitive science and computational phonology. <br><br>
  since the linguistics olympiad puzzles got me hooked on puzzles in language in school, i have been working on tricky problems in linguistics. my masters thesis is on automatic pseudowords generation (e.g. for LLM subword probes) in low resource languages and designing human evaluation setup & creating metrics for this fuzzy linguistic artefact. <br><br>
  at IIIT i have worked on code-mixed twitter morphology, password psycholinguistics, misinformation explanation, making new datasets, ontologies, behavioural experiments for Aphasia, and more. at MBZUAI i am probing LLM weaknesses in linguistic puzzles and ways to improve them in extremely low-resourced language tasks, while finishing up course projects in empathy + surprisal, efficiency + interpretability, loneliness + cultures, creativity, and historical linguistics! <br><br>    
  outside academia, i worked on jira ticket summaries, consulted in legal NLP, and coded up data cleaners & phonological transcription rules for dialects at startups. i have interned at Amazon for better fairness & de-biasing through adversarial prompting & artificial data augmentation. as a data scientist, i have built agentic assistant chatbots, with customizable RAG on top of Llama including the UX, Architecture, full-stack haberdashery, and more. <br><br><br>    
  So, if you're into language, tech, comics, design, quizzing, or just curious about what I’m up to, look around or hit me up! I keep it real, and it's always interesting :)
