short_bio: >-
  before this i completed my <b>MSc. in Computational Linguistics</b> at IIIT Hyderabad. <br><br>
  i have been chasing tricky problems in linguistics since olympiad puzzles got me hooked on the field in school. my masters thesis (cog.sci. + computational phonology) is on automatic <b>pseudowords generation</b> (e.g. for LLM subword probes) in low-resource languages and designing <b>native speaker evaluation</b> for this fuzzy linguistic artefact. <br><br>
  at <b>IIIT</b> i have worked on code-mixed twitter morphology, password psycholinguistics, misinformation explanation, making new datasets, ontologies, behavioural experiments for aphasia, and more. at <b>MBZUAI</b> i am probing LLM weaknesses in linguistic puzzles and ways to improve them in extremely low-resourced language tasks, while dabbling in empathy, interpretability, loneliness, creativity, and historical linguistics! <br><br>    
  outside academia, i've worked on jira ticket summaries, and coded up phonological transcription rules for dialects at startups. i have interned at Amazon for better fairness & de-biasing through adversarial prompting & artificial data augmentation. as a data scientist, i have built agentic assistant chatbots, with customizable RAG on top of Llama including the UX, Architecture, full-stack haberdashery, and more. <br><br><br>    
  So, if you're into <b>language, tech, comics, design, quizzing</b>, or just curious about what I‚Äôm up to, look around or hit me up! I keep it real, and it's always interesting :)
