short_bio: >-
  over the last 1.5 years, i have cornered LLMs to <b>(1)</b> probe which linguistic features correlate with their low performance on <b>metalinguistic reasoning puzzles</b> (<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=fcRcl1EXc4">COLM, 2025</a>), <b>(2)</b> observing the extent of <b>LLM modeling of human linguistic variation</b> in verb choice in a code-mixed Hindi-English sentence (under review), and <b>(3)</b> how LLMs reproduce abstract <b>hierarchical sequences</b> from a <b>cognitive-science lens</b> (WIP). <br><br>
  before this i completed my <b>MSc. in Computational Linguistics</b> at IIIT Hyderabad. linguistic complexity and how tech models it, was also the theme for my masters thesis on <b>pseudowords generation</b> (e.g. for LLM subword probes) and <b>native speaker evaluation design</b> in low-resource languages. this theme started inspiring me since i was a high schooler, solving actual linguistic reasoning puzzles for fun.<br><br>
  a list of other things i liked working on- empathy, interpretability, creativity, historical linguistics, code-mixed twitter morphology, password psycholinguistics, making new datasets & ontologies (misinformation, loneliness, etc.), behavioural experiment design (aphasia, syntactic distortion, etc.), and more! <br><br>    
  outside academia, ive worked on jira ticket summaries, and coded up phonological transcription rules for dialects at startups. i have interned at Amazon for better fairness & de-biasing through adversarial prompting & artificial data augmentation. as a data scientist, i have built agentic assistant chatbots, with customizable RAG on top of Llama including the UX, Architecture, full-stack haberdashery, and more. <br><br><br>    
  So, if you're into <b>language, tech, comics, design, quizzing</b>, or just curious about what I’m up to, look around or hit me up! I keep it real, and it's always interesting :)
