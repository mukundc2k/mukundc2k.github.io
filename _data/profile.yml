  Welcome to a window into what I'm about and which latest swing I am currently trying out in the playground of linguistics and tech. The Panini Linguistics Olympiad got me hooked on puzzles in language in school, and since then, I have been bouncing around, chasing that next puzzle. I am now sliding down into historical linguistics, meta-linguistics, low-resource languages, cognitive science, LLM efficiency, and more as a PhD student. <br><br>
  Over at IIIT Hyderabad, I monkey-barred over more &lt;computer science, cognitive science&gt; + linguistics. It was a fun sandbox for me to remix research in computational linguistics, Twitter code-mixed morphology, password psycholinguistics, dissect pseudowords, explain misinformation, loop back low-resource Indian languages into NLP trends, construct datasets, guide annotations, ideate new ontologies, design behavioural experiments for Aphasia, swiping through food menus for ordering the next new thing, etc. <br><br>
  While I worked these out on collaborations and built up my master's thesis, the industry NLP merry-go-round showed me the other side. I sifted through customer issues to generate insights at intelo.ai and coded up data cleaners & Tamil phonology for dialects at Navana, both startups. I have had my hands in the sandy, ever-changing landscape of Generative AI from 2022-24 in the form of consulting in Legal NLP at Lexapar (JSW), interning at Amazon for better fairness & de-biasing through adversarial prompting & artificial data augmentation, and as a data scientist at Jio Platforms (Reliance) building agent assistant chatbots with automated actions, customizable databases on top of Llama which included being backstage on the UX, Architecture, full-stack haberdashery, etc. <br><br><br>    
  So, if you're into language, tech, comics, design, quizzing, or just curious about what I‚Äôm up to, look around or hit me up! I keep it real, and it's always interesting :)
