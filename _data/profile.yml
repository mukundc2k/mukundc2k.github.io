  to this end, over the last 1.5 years i have cornered LLMs to <b>(1)</b> probe which linguistic features correlate with their low performance on metalinguistic reasoning puzzles (COLM, 2025), <b>(2)</b> observing the extent of LLM modeling of human linguistic variation in verb choice in a code-mixed Hindi-English sentence (under review), and <b>(3)</b> how LLMs model abstract hierarchical sequences in comparison to living beings from a cognitive-science lens (WIP).
  before this i completed my <b>MSc. in Computational Linguistics</b> at IIIT Hyderabad. <br><br>
  the fun puzzle of linguistic complexity and how tech models it, has been my muse for my masters thesis (cog.sci. + computational phonology), on <b>pseudowords generation</b> (e.g. for LLM subword probes) and <b>native speaker evaluation</b> in low-resource languages. it also inspired me as a high schooler who was solving literal linguistic reasoning puzzles for fun.<br><br>
  at <b>IIIT</b> i have worked on code-mixed twitter morphology, password psycholinguistics, misinformation explanation, making new datasets, ontologies, behavioural experiments for aphasia, and more. at <b>MBZUAI</b> i am probing LLM weaknesses in linguistic puzzles and ways to improve them in extremely low-resourced language tasks, while dabbling in empathy, interpretability, loneliness, creativity, and historical linguistics! <br><br>    
  outside academia, i've worked on jira ticket summaries, and coded up phonological transcription rules for dialects at startups. i have interned at Amazon for better fairness & de-biasing through adversarial prompting & artificial data augmentation. as a data scientist, i have built agentic assistant chatbots, with customizable RAG on top of Llama including the UX, Architecture, full-stack haberdashery, and more. <br><br><br>    
  So, if you're into <b>language, tech, comics, design, quizzing</b>, or just curious about what I’m up to, look around or hit me up! I keep it real, and it's always interesting :)
