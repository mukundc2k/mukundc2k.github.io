  since i already dropped Chucky and horror, this is the time for some hard hitting, well made, evergreen animated series, that is close to my heart. korra et al. (and aang) are a handful of growing up teen tropes that turn into a very nuanced portrayal of trauma, geopolitics, friendships, history, being a whole self, and bonds that are closer. some flashbacks fall through as my phd brings out the worst of me.
