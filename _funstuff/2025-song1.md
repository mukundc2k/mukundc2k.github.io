  since i namedropped doja last year and since all her discography inspires me, here's her. i love the art that she puts out, in the form of performances (ref: snl aahhh men!!! and gorgeous, and mtv), stage presence (ref: vie tour, scarlet tour, and more), fashion, and of course albums + collabs. she combines my favorite genres and experiments a lot, not all of them work for the people, but she is confident in herself and keeps learning!
