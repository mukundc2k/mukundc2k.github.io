  Non-supernatural horror has been my favourite genre. I love movies that make me think; they are relaxing. The Substance turned out to be the best for that this year. I paired that with It's What's Inside and a Chucky (movies and series) binge. A big sci-fi thriller series recommendation, which is super well made in the same vein, is Russian Doll. Natasha Lyonne has been mesmerising between this, But I'm a Cheerleader, and His Three Daughters!
