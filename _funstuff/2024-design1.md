  I follow design and fashion choices/patterns/intricacies in architecture, clothes, and more. I appreciate creators in the field pointing out these details for the people outside the field, which makes it more accessible for everyone and social media a better place for me! This channel on Instagram is a new find that explores some very well-thought-out but rarely talked-about architectural feats in India.
