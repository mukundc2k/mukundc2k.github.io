  I love comics; since high school, I have been into comics around X-Men and Batman as popular properties, but also psych thrillers, philosophy-related, and other kinds of indie stories. I closely follow critiques, lettering stylistics, panel layouts, colouring, design choices, story collaborations, etc. I am highlighting one of the most memorable and highly rated of my all-time reads with a Muller-designed cover. This comic has a very fun premise from the drop and turns out in a wildly paced, deep exploration of characters. If you end up reading, Dio(nysus) is the one I vibe with the most!
