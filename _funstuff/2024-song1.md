  I am currently into R&B, hyperpop, indie pop, hip-hop, etc. This album has taken over almost the entirety of 2024 for me! It has been a fascinating rollout in terms of creativity, both in collaborations and in design decisions. The idea of a follow-up album to the hit, which finds a reimagination of all the songs, was also brilliant to me! My headphones have either streamed Charli or Doja most of the year. By the way, I love Bharg, Ella Mai, and Shygirl's rise and hope for bigger!
