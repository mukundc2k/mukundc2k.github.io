  outside of academic news, there's more academic-adjacent news this year. across ai4gs, indoml, aacl-ijcnlp, and mbzuai symposium (i hope), i ended up meeting reallly cool people. a special mention to the long chats with Profs. Mrinmaya, Aditya (Joshi), Saif (from NRC), and the catch up chats with Profs. Dipti & Manish (IIIT), all of which again got me thinking, reminiscing, and looking forward to a lot. here's me being shot while i was trying to keep myself and Saumitra awake 😅
