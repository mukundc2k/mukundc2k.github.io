  while i would love to drop another puzzle, i have been more into language change as it happens this year, and people who have been putting that puzzle together neatly. how 67 got a new meaning and what that implies in the larger context of language, society, art, culture, and power is analysed very well by aidan here (who has also penned literature titled: "on skibidi").
